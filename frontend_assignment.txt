The assignment is as follows:

Build a dashboard page according to the attached design, using HTML/CSS.
Build a server side application based on NodeJS + ExpressJS, that will serve the files to the client.
Use AngularJS or Angular (with or without TypeScript) for getting 'data.json' from the server, and generate the values in the dashboard page.

Emphasis should be placed on the following:
    - Supply a detailed README.md file, that explains how to run your app.
    - Write clean code. Do not document unnecessary lines.
    - Use conventional guidelines:
        - http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_conventions.asp.
    - You can use any external server/client side library that will help you build a better application (except bootstrap).
    - The webpage should look exactly like the design. Cut the graphics directly from the PNG, if you can't, tell me and i'll send you the assets.
    - Make sure the code works on the latest versions of the popuplar web browsers
    - It is recommended to use a linting tool that will validate the code stantards

Bonuses:
    - Use scss.
    - Use gulp and/or webpack/systemjs for building (compiling scss, compressing JavaScript, etc).
    - Make the dashboard page responsive as possible.
    - Add css animations.
    - Use npm and/or bower.
    - Put the provided data in a Mongodb instance and pull from the DB.
    - Use docker for running the Node/Mongo server.
